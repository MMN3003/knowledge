The **present perfect continuous** is formed with **_have/has been_** and the [_-ing_ form](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/node/1384) of the verb.

We normally use the present perfect continuous to **emphasize that something is still continuing in the present**:

> _She **has been living** in Liverpool all her life.  
> It**'s been raining** for hours.  
> I'm tired out. I**'ve been working** all day.  
> They **have been staying** with us since last week._

We do **not** normally use the present perfect continuous with **[stative verbs](action%20and%20stative%20verbs#stative%20verbs)**. We use the **[[Present perfect]] simple** instead:

> 	_I**'ve** always ~~been liking~~ **liked** John._
