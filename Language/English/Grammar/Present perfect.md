The **present perfect** is formed from the present tense of the verb _**have**_ and the [past participle](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/node/1352) of a verb.

We use the present perfect:

1. for something that **started in the past** and **continues in the present**:
    

> _They**'ve been married** for nearly fifty years.  
> She **has lived** in Liverpool all her life._

2. when we are talking about our **experience up to the present**:

> _I**'ve seen** that film before.  
> I**'ve played** the guitar ever since I was a teenager.  
> He **has written** three books and he is working on another one._

We often use the adverb _**ever**_ to talk about experience up to the present:

> _My last birthday was the worst day I **have ever had**._

and we use _**never**_ for the [negative form](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/node/1363):

> _**Have** you **ever met** George?  
> Yes, but I**'ve never met** his wife._

3. for something that **happened in the past** but is **important in the present**:

> _I can't get in the house. I**'ve lost** my keys.  
> Teresa isn't at home. I think she **has gone** shopping._

## **_have been_ and _have gone_**

We use **_have/has been_** when someone has **_gone_** to a place and **_returned_**:

> _A: Where **have** you **been**?  
> B: I**'ve** just **been** out **to** the supermarket._

> _A: **Have** you **ever been to** San Francisco?  
> B: No, but I**'ve been to** Los Angeles._

But when someone **has not returned**, we use _**have/has gone**_:

> _A: Where's Maria? I haven't seen her for weeks.  
> B: She**'s gone to** Paris for a week. She'll be back tomorrow._
