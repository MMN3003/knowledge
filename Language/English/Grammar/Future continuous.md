We can use the future continuous (_will/won't be_ + -_ing_ form) to talk about future actions that: 

- will be in progress at a specific time in the future:

> _When you come out of school tomorrow, I'll be boarding a plane.  
> Try to call before 8 o'clock. After that, we'll be watching the match.  
> You can visit us during the first week of July. I won't be working then._

- we see as new, different or temporary:

> _Today we're taking the bus but next week we'll be taking the train.  
> He'll be staying with his parents for several months while his father is in recovery.  
> Will you be starting work earlier with your new job?_
