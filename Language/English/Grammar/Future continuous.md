We can use the future continuous (_will/won't be_ + -_ing_ form) to talk about future actions that: 

- will be in progress at a specific time in the future:

> _When you come out of school tomorrow, I'll be boarding a plane.  
> Try to call before 8 o'clock. After that, we'll be watching the match.  
> You can visit us during the first week of July. I won't be working then._

- we see as new, different or temporary:

> _Today we're taking the bus but next week we'll be taking the train.  
> He'll be staying with his parents for several months while his father is in recovery.  
> Will you be starting work earlier with your new job?_


You can use the future continuous to tell people about plans that affect them or to go over plans you have agreed on you can also use it to politely ask people about their own plans.

>_I will be calling you later.(= we already agreed on this.)
>I'll call you later(= I just decided.)
>will you be paying with a credit card or a debit card?
