We use the future perfect simple (_will/won't have_ + past participle) to talk about something that will be completed before a specific time in the future.

> _The guests are coming at 8 p.m. I'll have finished cooking by then.  
> On 9 October we'll have been married for 50 years.  
> Will you have gone to bed when I get back?_

We can use phrases like _by_ or _by the time_ (meaning 'at some point before') and _in_ or _in a day's time / in two months' time / in five years' time_ etc. (meaning 'at the end of this period') to give the time period in which the action will be completed.

> _I won't have written all the reports by next week.  
> By the time we arrive, the kids will have gone to bed.  
> I'll have finished in an hour and then we can watch a film.  
> In three years' time, I'll have graduated from university._
