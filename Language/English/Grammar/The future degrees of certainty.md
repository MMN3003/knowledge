## Grammar explanation

We can show how certain we are about the future by using modal verbs and other expressions.

### Modal verbs and adverbs

We can use modal verbs (such as _will_, _might_, _may_ or _could_) and adverbs (such as _probably_ and _definitely_) to show how sure we are.

#### Very sure

> _People **will definitely** work from home more in the future.  
> Robots **definitely won't** replace all human jobs._

#### Sure

> _Donna **will** really enjoy this film.  
> You **won't** regret it._

#### Almost sure

> _We**'ll probably** finish the project by tomorrow.  
> He **probably won't** have enough time._

#### Not sure

> _I **might go** to the party, but I'm not sure yet.  
> He hasn't studied much, so he **might not** pass the exam._

When you are not sure, we can also use _may_, _could_ and _may not_. However, we don't usually use _could not_ to talk about the future.

### Other expressions

We can also use other expressions such as _be bound to_ and _be likely to_, or verbs such as _think_ and _doubt_.

#### Very sure

> _He**'s bound to** feel nervous before his driving test.  
> She**'s certain to** get that job!  
> He**'s certain that** he**'ll** get here on time.  
> **There's no chance that** we**'ll** ever win the lottery.  
> **There's no way that** my boss **will** give me the day off._ 

#### Sure

> _I**'m sure that** you**'ll** do well in the interview.  
> **Are you sure that** you **won't** be available?_

#### Almost sure

> _The government**'s likely to** call an election soon.  
> Ali**'s unlikely to** be invited to the party.  
> **There's a good chance that** it**'ll** snow this week.

> I **doubt** they**'ll** have any trouble finding the address.  
> What do you **expect** mobile phones **will** be like in ten years' time?_

#### Not sure

> **There's a chance that** he **might** come and visit us next week.  
> I **think** we **might** see more of these problems in the next few years.
