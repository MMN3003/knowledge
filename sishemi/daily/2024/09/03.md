Got it! Hereâ€™s how you can update the changelog to include the MongoDB aggregation query and a warning to run it on the `events` collection:

```markdown
## Changelog

### Added
- **Badge Count in APN**: Added badge count functionality to the APN, reflecting the number of unread notifications.
- **RSVP Attendance for Event Owner**: Created an RSVP attendance record for the event owner, ensuring they are marked as attending.
- **RSVP Record for Event Owner**: Implemented a MongoDB query to add RSVP records for event owners.

### Changed
- **RSVP Needed Label**: Updated all events with RSVP enabled to display "(RSVP Needed)".
- **Show RSVP Attendance**: Modified settings to allow RSVP attendance to be visible to everyone.
- **Event Ownership**: Adjusted ownership settings for all events created in production from August 19th onwards.

### Important Notice
To create RSVP records for event owners, please run the following MongoDB aggregation pipeline on the `events` collection:

```json
[
  {
    "$match": {
      "is_rsvp_enabled": true
    }
  },
  {
    "$project": {
      "event_id": "$_id",
      "user_id": "$user_id",
      "status": {
        "$literal": "NO_RESPONSE"
      },
      "expires_at": {
        "$add": [
          "$end",
          86400000
        ]
      },
      "created_at": "$created_at"
    }
  },
  {
    "$merge": {
      "into": "eventrsvps", 
      "on": ["user_id", "event_id"],
      "whenMatched": "keepExisting",
      "whenNotMatched": "insert"
    }
  }
]
```

**Warning**: This query must be executed on the `events` collection to ensure that RSVP records are properly created for event owners. Failure to run this may result in missing RSVP records.


This entry clearly communicates the need to run the provided MongoDB query on the `events` collection and warns about the potential consequences of not doing so.
