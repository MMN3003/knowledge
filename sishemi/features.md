---

**Collaboration Document between IMA TEAM and My Camp**

**Purpose**: This document outlines the key features and integrations that IMA TEAM requires from My Camp, a payment portal provider, to enhance the functionality and payment experience within the IMA TEAM application.

---

### Features Required from My Camp

1. **Creation of Multiple Payment Portal Links**
   - Ability to generate unique payment portal links for each user within IMA TEAM.
   - Each link should be customizable for individual users as needed.

2. **Expiration Date for Payment Links**
   - The generated payment portal links must have an optional expiration date feature to ensure security and control over payment timelines.

3. **Webhook Integration for Payment Link Information**
   - My Camp should provide a webhook service that sends detailed information to IMA TEAMâ€™s server whenever a payment link is created. 
   - The data sent should include:
     - **User Information**: Details about the user for whom the link is created.
     - **Organization Information**: Details of the organization associated with the user.
     - **Payment Portal Information**: Including the generated portal link and any other relevant metadata.

4. **API or Webhook for Transaction and Balance Information**
   - My Camp should offer either:
     - An **API** to retrieve the total balance and detailed transaction history, including transaction amounts and associated user names.
     - Alternatively, a **webhook** that sends all transaction details to IMA TEAMâ€™s server. The webhook should provide:
       - **Transaction Details**: Including transaction amounts, timestamps, and descriptions.
       - **User Information**: Linking transactions to specific users.
       - **Portal Information**: Details about the payment portal used.

5. **Redirect Link for Portal Creation**
   - A mechanism to create a redirect link for IMA TEAM users that takes them directly to the My Camp portal setup page.
   - This should simplify the process of setting up payment portals for users within the IMA TEAM app.

Please review and provide feedback or additional requirements to finalize the collaboration terms.
