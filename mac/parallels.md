A tool for Parallels Desktop can start VMs even expired (Support for 17.1.0)  
PDrunner will show an icon in the menu bar.  
Click icon to list all the VMs on your Mac, and click the name to start your VM.  
Go to PD official website to download PD 17 trial version:  
(Support Parallels Desktop 17.1)  
After downloading and installing, run PD (you need to log in to your account!!!) If you don’t have an account, sign up for a pd account, then log in, click on trial after logging in and you will be sent a 14-day trial).  
Then install a Windows virtual machine or a linux/Ubuntu virtual machine (if you don’t have a virtual machine, you must install one first, if you have one, you can skip this step).  
Quit the running PD completely (or restart your computer if you don’t know how), then run the installed “PD Runner”, a player-like icon will appear in the menu bar, click it, and then click the virtual machine you need to start.
