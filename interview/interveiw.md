"Hello, I'm Mohsen. Over the past 6 years, my professional journey in software development began with Angular. However, due to team needs, after a while, I decided to enter the world of Node.js, and since then, I've enjoyed being a full-stack developer, working across various layers.

Throughout this journey, I've worked with languages like Go, JavaScript, and C#, and I'm also familiar with Java and the Spring Boot framework. I've also worked with different databases such as Redis, Oracle, and MSSQL. Familiarity with microservices design concepts and web design has enabled me to develop more than 20 different services.

My learning speed and perseverance allow me to quickly progress and adapt to the team's needs and environment, utilizing various tools and languages."

In my recent company, we faced a challenge where, due to certain reasons, they had a completely separate instance of a monolithic service for each city. This made it difficult to have consolidated reports. I suggested solving this by aggregating users and access rights. We addressed this issue by creating an SSO (Single Sign-On) and IAM (Identity and Access Management) service


One of the mistakes I made was storing database backup files in the same data center as the primary database. As a result, during a cyber attack on the data center, both the database and the backups stored there were compromised. However, after replacing the Oracle database files with a new service and cleaning up the corrupted data, I was able to recover access to over 95% of the data
