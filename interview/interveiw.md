"Hello, I'm Mohsen. Over the past 6 years, my professional journey in software development began with Angular. However, due to team needs, after a while, I decided to enter the world of Node.js, and since then, I've enjoyed being a full-stack developer, working across various layers.

Throughout this journey, I've worked with languages like Go, JavaScript, and C#, and I'm also familiar with Java and the Spring Boot framework. I've also worked with different databases such as Redis, Oracle, and MSSQL. Familiarity with microservices design concepts and web design has enabled me to develop more than 20 different services.

My learning speed and perseverance allow me to quickly progress and adapt to the team's needs and environment, utilizing various tools and languages."

In my recent company, we faced a challenge where, due to certain reasons, they had a completely separate instance of a monolithic service for each city. This made it difficult to have consolidated reports. I suggested solving this by aggregating users and access rights. We addressed this issue by creating an SSO (Single Sign-On) and IAM (Identity and Access Management) service


One of the mistakes I made was storing database backup files in the same data center as the primary database. As a result, during a cyber attack on the data center, both the database and the backups stored there were compromised. However, after replacing the Oracle database files with a new service and cleaning up the corrupted data, I was able to recover access to over 95% of the data






1. Hello, I'm Mohsen. With over 6 years of experience as a full-stack software engineer, I've developed a passion for tackling complex challenges and continuously expanding my skill set.

My expertise spans across a variety of technologies, including Golang, Node.js, Angular, and I have a solid understanding of Java and the Spring Boot framework. This diverse background allows me to seamlessly navigate through all layers of the software stack, from frontend to backend development.

In addition to my programming skills, I have a strong understanding of infrastructure tools and containerization techniques, such as CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and ELK stack. I've leveraged these tools to optimize development workflows and ensure efficient deployment of applications.

Moreover, I'm well-versed in working with different communication protocols like HTTP, gRPC, and WebSocket, enabling seamless integration between various components of the system.

In a previous role, I successfully implemented an event-driven system using Kafka, which enhanced the scalability and responsiveness of the application architecture.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my diverse skill set and problem-solving mindset to your team and contribute to the success of your projects
