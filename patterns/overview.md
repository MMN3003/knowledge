1. **[[Singleton Pattern]]**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

2. **[[Factory Method Pattern]]**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3. **[[Abstract Factory Pattern]]**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4. **[[Builder Pattern]]**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

5. **[[Prototype Pattern]]**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, during runtime.

6. **[[Adapter Pattern]]**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into another interface that a client expects.

7. **[[Decorator Pattern]]**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

8. **[[Proxy Pattern]]**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

9. **[[Observer Pattern]]**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

10. **[[Strategy Pattern]]**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

11. **[[Command Pattern]]**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

12. **[[Chain of Responsibility Pattern]]**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

13. **[[Template Method Pattern]]**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

14. **[[State Pattern]]**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

15. **[[Visitor Pattern]]**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

These patterns help in solving common design problems by providing well-tested solutions that have been refined over time.
